# Idea
Similar with the problem 12865.
## Example
| Memory | 30  | 10  | 20  | 35  | 40  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cost   | 3   | 0   | 3   | 5   | 4   |

> If the new item {30, 3} must be included:  

| cost      | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | ... |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maximal M | 0   | 0   | 0   | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | ... |
> Or must not be included:  

| cost      | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | ... |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maximal M | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | ... |

Then get maximal for each cost.
> Iterate the items

| cost      | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | ... |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maximal M | 0   | 0   | 0   | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | ... |
|           | 10  | 10  | 10  | 40  | 40  | 40  | 40  | 40  | 40  | 40  | 40  | ... |
|           | 10  | 10  | 10  | 40  | 40  | 40  | 60  | 60  | 60  | 60  | 60  | ... |
|           | 10  | 10  | 10  | 40  | 40  | 45  | 60  | 60  | 75  | 75  | 75  | ... |
